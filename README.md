## About the Video Course
Do you want to learn the new ARCore 1.3 in Unity SDK? This course will teach you all the fundamentals of ARCore augmented reality so that you can get started developing your own augmented reality apps. In the app section, we show you how you can apply the basics to more advanced apps for either gaming or for productivity-based apps.This course is designed to help you understand the fundamentals of augmented reality using the ARCore in Unity through practical and easy to understand labs. This class covers these capabilities, including getting started, simple and multiple target detection, smart terrain as well as leap motion integration.

<UL>
<li>We designed this course for anyone who wants to learn the state of the art in using Google's ARCore SDK without the steep learning curve. </li>
<li>By the end of the course, you will be able to understand the fundamentals of ARCore SDK Core functionality from motion tracking, to point and plane detection and even test light estimation. </li>
<li>Thereafter you will soon be developing your own amazing augmented real-world applications. </li>
<li>In this course, we will begin with the fundamentals section by creating a simple hello AR app that will help you to quickly get something working. </li>
<li>Next, we will look at the first core functionality which is motion tracking and you will learn how spatial tracking works in AR.</li>
<li>The second core functionality of ARCore is point and plane detection. To detect feature points and how coplanar feature points form into planes.</li>
<li>Then we'll build a simple hit testing app where you can spawn random colored cubes or spheres with a simple touch using ray casting.</li>
<li>We'll end the basics section with simple light estimation, to make a monster appear or disappear at the flick of a physical light switch.</li>
<li>After that, we'll move on to the exciting part of the course where we create some really amazing ARCore 1.3 apps. </li>
<li>In the first lecture, you can build your own accurate measuring app using ARCore; there's a lot of practical uses for this app.</li>
<li>Thereafter we learn how to transverse within an AR scene by building a dragon that can move and fly in any direction as well as breathe fire. Next, we take flying to another level by building a drone in augmented reality.- For education, we demonstrate how you can build your own solar system and how to use touch ray casting to bring up information about the planets, moons, and stars.</li>
